## Day 1 — Data source

Chose EA FC26 player database (Kaggle) over scraping FBref/Transfermarkt directly.
Reason: single file with bio + market value + performance attributes together,
avoiding the need to merge multiple sources and match player names across them.
Tradeoff: performance stats are FIFA-game attribute ratings (pace, shooting, passing,
etc.), not real match statistics like goals/xG. Acceptable for MVP; documented as
a known limitation. Real match data (via FBref) noted as a v2 roadmap item.

Data quality check:
- 18,405 players, 110 columns, no duplicate player_ids.
- 89 nulls in club_name/league_name/contract fields — likely free agents/players
  without a current club. Will filter these out or flag them explicitly.
- 2,062 nulls in pace/shooting/passing/dribbling/defending/physic — confirmed these
  are exactly the 2,062 goalkeepers in the dataset, who have separate goalkeeping_*
  stats instead. Not a data quality issue, expected by design given the schema.

Note: player_positions is a multi-value string (e.g. "CDM, CM", "LM, RM, LW") —
will need parsing into a primary position field for clean filtering in the API.
